    <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to Battleship!</h1>
    <p class="lead">Welcome to Battleship. The game of guessing and out smarting your opponent.

        Battleship is a war-themed board game (or in this case, a game in the terminal) where you try to guess the opponents ship location and sink their ships.

        A paper and pencil version of this game dates back to World War 1, but most people are more familiar with the plastic board game first created in 1967.

        In this version of the game it is only single player, as you will be playing against a bad guessing algorithm.
